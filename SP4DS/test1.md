1. Cumulative Distribution Functions and Probability Density Functions
$T_n$
The random variable \( T_n \\) is the sum of \( n \\) i.i.d. positive and absolutely continuous random variables \( J_i \\). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \( T_n \\) is given by the \( n \\)-fold convolution of the CDF of \( J_1 \\): \[ F_{T_n}(t) = (F_{J_1} * F_{J_1} * \\cdots * F_{J_1})(t) = F_{J_1}^{*n}(t). \\] The probability density function (PDF) of \( T_n \\) is the \( n \\)-fold convolution of the PDF of \( J_1 \\): \[ f_{T_n}(t) = (f_{J_1} * f_{J_1} * \\cdots * f_{J_1})(t) = f_{J_1}^{*n}(t). \\]

\( N(t) \\)
The random variable \( N(t) \\) is the maximum integer \( n \\) such that \( T_n \\leq t \\). The CDF of \( N(t) \\) is: \[ F_{N(t)}(n) = P(N(t) \\leq n) = P(T_{n+1} > t) = 1 - F_{T_{n+1}}(t). \\] The PDF of \( N(t) \\) is: \[ f_{N(t)}(n) = P(N(t) = n) = P(T_n \\leq t < T_{n+1}) = F_{T_n}(t) - F_{T_{n+1}}(t). \\]

\( Z_n \\)
The random variable \( Z_n \\) is the sum of \( n \\) i.i.d. absolutely continuous random variables \( X_i \\). The CDF of \( Z_n \\) is given by the \( n \\)-fold convolution of the CDF of \( X_1 \\): \[ F_{Z_n}(z) = (F_{X_1} * F_{X_1} * \\cdots * F_{X_1})(z) = F_{X_1}^{*n}(z). \\] The PDF of \( Z_n \\) is the \( n \\)-fold convolution of the PDF of \( X_1 \\): \[ f_{Z_n}(z) = (f_{X_1} * f_{X_1} * \\cdots * f_{X_1})(z) = f_{X_1}^{*n}(z). \\]

\( Z(t) \\)
The random variable \( Z(t) \\) is \( Z_{N(t)} \\). The CDF of \( Z(t) \\) is: \[ F_{Z(t)}(z) = P(Z(t) \\leq z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(Z(t) \\leq z \\mid N(t) = n) P(N(t) = n) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} F_{Z_n}(z) f_{N(t)}(n). \\] The PDF of \( Z(t) \\) is: \[ f_{Z(t)}(z) = \\frac{d}{dz} F_{Z(t)}(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f_{Z_n}(z) f_{N(t)}(n). \\]

2. Finite Dimensional Distributions of the Process \( Z(t) \\)
The finite-dimensional distributions of the process \( Z(t) \\) are given by the joint distributions of \( Z(t_1), Z(t_2), \\ldots, Z(t_k) \\) for any \( t_1 < t_2 < \\cdots < t_k \\). These distributions can be derived using the properties of the processes \( N(t) \\) and \( Z_n \\).

3. Existence of the Process \( Z(t) \\) and Sample Paths
The process \( Z(t) \\) exists because it is defined as a composition of well-defined processes \( N(t) \\) and \( Z_n \\). The sample paths of \( Z(t) \\) are piecewise constant and right-continuous, with jumps at the event times \( T_n \\).

4. Conditions for \( Z(t) \\) to be a Markov Process
The process \( Z(t) \\) is a Markov process if the interevent times \( J_i \\) are exponentially distributed. This is because the exponential distribution is the only continuous distribution that is memoryless, which is a necessary condition for the Markov property.

5. Conditions for \( Z(t) \\) to be a Martingale
The process \( Z(t) \\) is a martingale if the expected value of each jump \( X_i \\) is zero, i.e., \( E[X_i] = 0 \\). This is because the expected value of the process at any time \( t \\) should be equal to its initial value, which is zero.
